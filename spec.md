## 1. Overview

**Objective:**  
Prevent distraction by disabling the TV when tasks aren’t completed. Initially, disable an LG TV via the lgtv2 Node.js library (see [hobbyquaker/lgtv2](https://github.com/hobbyquaker/lgtv2) and [statico/lg-tv-kid-timer](https://github.com/statico/lg-tv-kid-timer/blob/main/server.ts)). The architecture will be extensible so that future builds can integrate additional protocols (e.g., via REST, SSH, or custom APIs) to disable various devices or dispatch commands.

## 2. Functional Requirements

- **TV Control via LG TV API:**
  - Use the lgtv2 Node.js library to send commands to an LG TV.
  - Initially, implement a “disable” command (e.g., turning off or locking the TV).
- **Extensible Command Dispatch:**
  - Design a command-dispatch system that accepts various “actions” (e.g., disable, mute, etc.).
  - Implement an abstraction layer so that additional protocols can be plugged in without modifying the core logic.
- **Triggering Conditions:**

  - The disabling action should be triggered when a condition is met (for instance, an incomplete task is detected).
  - This spec focuses on the device control portion; integration with task checking (e.g., via Things 3) will be integrated later.

- **API Endpoints:**
  - Provide a local web API (REST endpoints) to trigger commands manually or via automation.
  - Endpoints should allow selecting which command and target device to control.

## 3. Architecture & Components

- **Command Dispatcher Module:**
  - A central module to dispatch commands based on a protocol identifier.
  - Example: `dispatchCommand(protocol, command, config)` where `protocol` might be `"lgtv"` initially.
- **Extensibility Layer:**
  - Use a plugin architecture (e.g., load command modules dynamically) so that additional protocols (e.g., router APIs, smart speakers) can be added later.
- **Web API:**

  - A lightweight Node.js server (using Express or similar) exposing endpoints to:
    - Trigger a command manually (e.g., POST `/command` with JSON payload: `{ protocol: "lgtv", command: "turnOff", config: { ip: "192.168.1.X", key: "..." } }`).
    - Optionally return status logs and error messages.

- **Configuration:**
  - A config file (or database) for storing device-specific settings (e.g., TV IP, authentication keys).
  - Make these settings modifiable via the web API in future iterations.

## 4. Data Handling & Error Strategies

- **Data Handling:**
  - Use JSON for API requests/responses.
  - Validate input for required fields (protocol, command, and config parameters).
- **Error Handling:**

  - Wrap commands in try/catch blocks.
  - Return HTTP error codes (e.g., 500 for internal errors, 400 for invalid input).
  - Log errors centrally with timestamps for troubleshooting.
  - Provide a fallback mechanism if a command fails (e.g., retry the command once or log and notify via the dashboard).

- **Extensibility:**
  - Define a standard interface for command modules:
    - Each module must export a method (e.g., `executeCommand(config, command)`) and return a promise.
  - Future modules can plug into the dispatcher without breaking the API.

---

## 5. Testing Plan

- **Unit Tests:**
  - Test the LG TV control module with mocked lgtv2 responses.
  - Validate the command dispatcher routing based on protocol identifiers.
  - Test input validation for API endpoints.
- **Integration Tests:**
  - Run tests on a real or simulated LG TV to verify that the command (e.g., turn off) is executed correctly.
  - Simulate API calls via Postman or curl to ensure correct responses.
- **Error & Edge Case Tests:**
  - Simulate connection failures or invalid configuration.
  - Verify that error messages are logged and proper HTTP error codes are returned.
- **Extensibility Tests:**
  - Create a dummy protocol module to verify the dispatcher correctly loads and executes new protocols.

## 6. Future Enhancements

- **Additional Protocols:**
  - Extend to support disabling internet on smart TVs via router APIs or parental control integrations.
- **Task Integration:**
  - Integrate with task management (e.g., Things 3) to automate triggering based on incomplete tasks.
- **UI Dashboard:**
  - Develop a simple web UI for monitoring status and managing configurations.
